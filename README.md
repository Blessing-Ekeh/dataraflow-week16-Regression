# Week 16 - Advanced Regression & Classification

This repository contains all datasets and **take‑home solutions** for completing the **Week 16 assignments** on *Advanced Regression & Classification Techniques*.  
Topics covered include:
- Random Forest Regression
- Model Performance Evaluation
- Logistic Regression
- Multi‑class Classification
- End‑to‑end project work (Customer Churn Prediction)

---  

## 📝 Datasets
Datasets are synthetic but realistic, designed to reinforce key ML concepts.  
See the **Data Dictionary** section for details on each dataset.

---

## 💡 Solutions
Each dataset is paired with a **Jupyter Notebook solution** that demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, handling missing values)
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparison of algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Interpretation of results and business insights

Solutions are organized by **Tasks**, **Assignments**, and **Assessment** to mirror the coursework structure.
